## If you want to make changes to the static web page
The github pages are served up from the gh-pages branch of the repo

* clone the repo to your local computer
* checkout the gh-pages branch - `git checkout gh-pages`
* do a pull to get the latest updates (only necessary if this is not a fresh clone) - `git pull`
* use your favorite editor to make inline modifications to the index.html file in html
* save your work
* add the changes to the git index to queue them for commit - `git add .`
* commit your changes (locally) - `git commit -m "replace this sentence with a nice informative comment here"`
* publish (push) your changes to the github repo (origin). This will make them publicly visible - `git push`

Review your changes on the published website. You may need to refresh the page to see the changes.
